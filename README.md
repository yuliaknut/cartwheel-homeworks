# Cartwheel course repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Watch this video](https://www.loom.com/share/de1cac47e1a44a79a05f8658157968ae) before beginning

The repository contains the Cartwheel support agent and starter code for all five modules of "Evaluating and Improving AI Agents." Cartwheel is a fictional commerce platform that hosts independent stores. You begin by completing the agent, then use the same repository for trace analysis, automated evaluation, continuous integration, adversarial evaluation, and improvement experiments.

Begin with the [homework index](homework/README.md). Each assignment names the code and records required for the corresponding module.

## Get started with Homework 1

The course instructors put together this [HW1 walkthrough](homework/module-1/hw1-tutorial.md) for anyone who wants a hand, including PMs. Your coding agent handles setup and coding while you decide what to expect and check the results.

Choose the walkthrough for step-by-step help, or ask your agent to jump into a task. You can ask for help whenever you get stuck and switch approaches at any time.

Open this repo in Codex, Claude Code, or your preferred coding agent and paste:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and help me get started with Homework 1.
```

If you haven't downloaded the repo yet, paste this instead:

```text
Help me get started with Homework 1 in https://github.com/ai-evals-course/cartwheel-homeworks. Use my existing local copy if I have one, or help me clone it. Then read AGENTS.md and help me choose how to proceed.
```

## Setup

You need Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Run the commands from the repository root.

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m seed.generate
uv run pytest
```

If `.env` does not exist, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Add a key for the model provider you will use, and preserve any existing settings. The tests and seed command do not require a model key.

The default model is `gpt-5.5` with OpenAI. You can select `claude-opus-4-6` with Anthropic or `glm-5.2` with Together AI using `CARTWHEEL_MODEL` in `.env`. The CLI's `--model` flag overrides the default. You need a key for only one provider.

The starter contains unfinished homework functions. Tests for unfinished functions report expected failures until you implement them. Follow [Homework 1](homework/module-1/hw1.md) to complete the five support tools, then use the chat interface:

```bash
uv run python -m agent.cli --role shopper --user 1
```

Add `--save hw1-session.jsonl` to save a conversation draft when you exit the CLI. It includes follow-up turns and tool results; add your assessment afterward as described in [Homework 1](homework/module-1/hw1.md).

CLI tracing is off by default. Building a non-OpenAI agent (including Ollama through LiteLLM) also removes the SDK's implicit OpenAI exporter for direct runs. Tracing destinations are process-wide; select Langfuse or explicitly opt into OpenAI tracing before running agents. Add `--debug` to print tool calls and results locally. To send traces to OpenAI, add `--trace-openai` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`; OpenAI hosted tracing is unavailable for zero-data-retention organizations. For the course's Langfuse setup, use `--trace` instead. The two tracing flags cannot be combined. `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1` disables SDK tracing for either destination.

The default development seed is the executable course world: 20 stores, 800
products, 525 users, 10,000 orders, and 18 policy documents. The seed script
is deterministic. Two runs produce identical data, and the
three demo orders from lecture (#4127, #3980, #4455, all owned by shopper
user 1) always come out the same. The seed also inserts six documented data
quality defects for challenge scenarios. Their identifiers and expected
handling are stored in the `data_quality_cases` table.

## Homework 2 and tracing

[Homework 2](homework/module-1/hw2.md) asks you to implement the authenticated endpoints and add application attributes to traces. The tracing setup is provided through OpenLLMetry and self-hosted Langfuse. The four HW2 functions listed below are intentionally unfinished; starting the server alone does not complete them.

Homework 2 also requires Docker with Compose. Follow the assignment for starting Langfuse and the server, configuring content capture, and verifying the exported spans. The local Langfuse settings are supplied in `.env.example`, and no Langfuse Cloud account is required.

## Module 1 implementation tasks

| Homework | File | Holes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HW1 | `agent/tools.py` | `get_policy`, `search_products`, `list_my_orders`, `cancel_order`, `find_order` |
| HW2 | `observability/instrument.py` | `record_tool_result`, `_set_permission_denied_attributes` |
| HW2 | `server/app.py` | `create_session`, `post_message` |

The Module 1 implementation tasks are marked `### YOUR CODE HERE (HW1)` or `### YOUR CODE HERE (HW2)` and have docstrings describing the expected behavior. The supplied contract tests in `tests/test_hw_holes.py` cover the five HW1 tools and HW2 session creation. Homework 2 also asks you to write authentication tests and verify exported spans in Langfuse. Use the test commands in each assignment to check your implementation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Module 1 handouts are in `homework/module-1/`. The [homework index](homework/README.md) lists all released assignments. A [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/qO98jDayTHo?si=gLN5FZ3FDiAIs_gG) of how to attempt Homework 1 is also available.
