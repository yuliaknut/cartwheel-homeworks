# Homework 1, implementing and examining the support agent

Homework 1 asks you to complete five tools for the Cartwheel support agent and examine the resulting behavior through manual conversations.

## Expected work

- Estimated time: 3 to 4.5 hours for a student who is comfortable with Python, or 4.5 to 6 hours for a student who is learning the repository and agent framework.
- Expected Python code: approximately 80 to 130 lines across five required functions in `agent/tools.py`, plus your own tools.
- Other work: at least 10 JSONL records, an analysis of one possible system prompt revision, and a video of no more than 5 minutes.

The estimates vary with the student's familiarity with Python and the model provider. The estimate includes time to explore the agent beyond the required cases, because Part C depends on observing how the model interprets the specification.

## Preparation

A [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/qO98jDayTHo?si=gLN5FZ3FDiAIs_gG) of how to approach this assignment is available. Watch it before you begin for an overview of the expected workflow.

Run the assignment from the repository root. Install the Python environment and generate the local Cartwheel data:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m seed.generate
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` does not already exist, then add the key for the model you will use during the manual session. The tests and seed command do not require a model key, but the command line chat does.

The seed command creates `data/cartwheel.db`, a local SQLite database containing the stores, products, users, orders, refunds, and escalations used by the assignment. The command also creates the policy documents under `data/policies/`. Generation is deterministic, so every student receives the same demonstration orders and policy facts. No external database service is required.

Confirm the generated files before implementing a tool:

```bash
ls data/cartwheel.db
ls data/policies
```

The starter contains the following components:

- `data/cartwheel.db` contains the stores, products, users, and orders used by the support application. The seed program generates the same records for every student.
- `agent/cli.py` provides a text interface for conversations with the support agent.
- `agent/auth.py` loads the selected user and provides the user's role to every tool.
- `agent/agent.py` contains three completed tools for help center search, order lookup, and refunds.
- `agent/tools.py` contains five unfinished tools for policy lookup, product search, order listing, cancellation, and fuzzy order search.
- `tests/test_hw_holes.py` contains one supplied contract test for each unfinished tool.

The agent has access only to the Cartwheel function tools registered in `TOOLS_BY_ROLE` in `agent/agent.py`. The agent does not receive a filesystem, shell, web, or file search tool. A model instruction is not an access control mechanism, so the order tools still check the authenticated user before returning private information.

Before editing the code, read the following files:

- `SPEC.md`, which defines the support agent's accepted requests, permissions, tool behavior, and escalation rules.
- `agent/auth.py`, which implements authorization by role.
- One completed tool function in `agent/agent.py`, which illustrates the tool result conventions.
- The docstring of each function marked for Homework 1.

The supplied data access layer in `agent/db.py` provides the database operations needed by the unfinished tools:

- `search_products` uses `get_store_by_name` and `list_products`.
- `list_my_orders` uses `list_orders_for_user` or `list_orders_for_store`.
- `cancel_order` uses `get_order` and `set_order_status`.
- `get_policy` reads the generated policy files with `load_policy_docs` from `agent/helpcenter.py`.
- `find_order` uses `list_order_search_candidates` to retrieve the complete authorised order scope and `list_products` to map product IDs to titles. Pass `user_id=ctx.user_id` for shoppers, `store_id=ctx.store_id` for merchants, or `all_orders=True` only for support staff. These scope values come from the authenticated context, never from the search query. The helper requires exactly one scope; do not omit it or use unrestricted access as a fallback for an invalid role or missing identity.

Use `with db.connection() as conn:` for database access. It closes the connection
automatically, including on early returns and errors:

```python
with db.connection() as conn:
    order = db.get_order(conn, order_id)
```

The supplied write helpers commit their changes. The `with` block only handles
closing; it does not commit pending writes. Existing code that uses `db.connect()`
and closes it explicitly still works. A bare `with db.connect()` does not close
a SQLite connection.

Use the supplied functions rather than writing a second database layer. No changes to `db.py` are needed for `find_order`: implement the role selection and product-name matching in the tool, keep matches in the helper's newest-first order (descending order ID breaks ties), and return the first five using `Order.to_public_dict()`. Apply matching before the five-result limit; the older listing helpers default to 20 recent orders and can miss older matches. Each tool docstring states the required inputs, return value, and error behavior.

`SPEC.md` is a design document; the running application does not load it. The starter translates the specification into three kinds of implementation:

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `agent/agent.py` contains the scope, refusal, tool choice, citation, and escalation instructions needed by the model.
- `agent/auth.py` and the tool functions enforce permissions, because authorization cannot depend on whether the model follows an instruction.
- `facts.yaml`, `seed/eligibility.py`, and the refund tool enforce numerical policy rules, including the return period and approval threshold.

Homework 1 completes the missing tool contracts from the specification. During the manual session, compare the observed behavior with the specification. Part C asks you to revise the system prompt only when the missing behavior concerns a decision made by the model; a failure in authorization or state changes belongs in code.

## Part A, implement the five support tools

Implement the following functions in `agent/tools.py`:

- `get_policy`
- `search_products`
- `list_my_orders`
- `cancel_order`
- `find_order`

Follow the contract in each docstring, including its return schema and error behavior. For `cancel_order`, check whether the caller may access the order before returning any information about it. After authorization succeeds, check whether the shipment state permits cancellation.

`find_order` takes a natural language query (e.g., "earmuffs I bought last week") and searches orders within the caller's authorised scope by product name. You may use a fuzzy string matching library such as `thefuzz` or `rapidfuzz`, or case-insensitive substring matching for a simpler approach.

Run the focused tests while you work:

```bash
uv run pytest --runxfail tests/test_hw_holes.py -k hw1
```

The `--runxfail` option makes an unfinished function fail instead of appearing as an expected failure. Before you implement a function, its test should report a `NotImplementedError`. After you implement all five functions correctly, all selected HW1 tests should pass, including the additional `find_order` role and search-coverage cases.

During Part B conversations you will notice things the agent cannot do because no tool exists. Add more tools of your own to fill those gaps. Some ideas:

- Check whether an order is eligible for a return or refund
- Track shipment status and delivery dates
- Look up public store information and policy overrides
- Summarize a customer's recent order history

To add a tool, write a function decorated with `@function_tool` in `agent/tools.py` with a clear docstring (the SDK uses it as the tool description the model sees), then add it to `TOOLS_BY_ROLE` in `agent/agent.py` for the appropriate roles.

Then run the supplied tests for the completed tools, authorization rules, and refund rules:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_agent_tools.py tests/test_auth.py tests/test_eligibility.py
```

## Part B, examine the agent through manual conversations

Run at least 10 conversations with the completed support agent. Use all three authenticated roles, and save one record for each conversation.

Include every case in the following list:

- An authorized shopper request concerning order `4127`.
- A request concerning order `3980`, which is outside the refund window.
- A refund request for order `4455`, whose amount exceeds the automatic approval threshold.
- A merchant from store 2 requesting order `4127`, which belongs to store 1.
- A question whose answer depends on a policy override for one store.
- A request outside the support agent's stated scope.

The required order cases depend on permissions stored in the local database. Use shopper user `1` for orders `4127`, `3980`, and `4455`, because the shopper owns all three orders. Use merchant user `9002` for the request about order `4127`, because the merchant belongs to store 2 while the order belongs to store 1. Support user `9501` is available when you want to test the support role.

Use the command that matches the identity you want to test:

```bash
uv run python -m agent.cli --role shopper --user 1 --save hw1-session.jsonl
uv run python -m agent.cli --role merchant --user 9002 --save hw1-session.jsonl
uv run python -m agent.cli --role support --user 9501 --save hw1-session.jsonl
```

The commands select the authenticated identity, but they do not determine the request.

`--save` appends one conversation draft to `hw1-session.jsonl` when you quit,
press Ctrl-C at the input prompt, or reach the end of input. Keep follow-up
turns in the same CLI session; quit and restart for a separate conversation.
Existing records are preserved. Without `--save`, the CLI does not write this file.

The draft contains your authenticated identity, requests, tool calls and results,
and responses. Add your own `expected`, `requirement`, `met_requirement`, and
`problem_source` values afterward. These start as `null`; an unreviewed draft
does not count as a completed homework record.

Add `--debug` if you also want to see the tool calls in the terminal. Both
options work without Langfuse or the Homework 2 tracing setup. For example:

```bash
uv run python -m agent.cli --role shopper --user 1 --save hw1-session.jsonl --debug
```

Add four more conversations after reading `SPEC.md`. Here is the first case to add: as shopper user `1`, ask, "Can you change the email address on my Cartwheel account to new@example.com?" Determine the expected behavior from `SPEC.md`, then compare the expected behavior with the agent's response. Design the remaining three conversations yourself, including the role, user, and request for each conversation.

A refund or cancellation changes the local database. If you want to test another conversation against the original order state, run `uv run python -m seed.generate` before starting the next conversation. Keep the same database state throughout a conversation you are recording.

Review each saved conversation in `hw1-session.jsonl`. Each completed record must contain:

- `role`, the authenticated role.
- `user_id`, the authenticated user's identifier.
- `store_id`, the authenticated merchant's store, or `null` for other roles.
- `request`, the initial user request.
- `tool_calls`, a list containing each tool name, its arguments, and its result. Use an empty list when the agent called no tools.
- `response`, the agent's final response to the last turn.
- `expected`, the behavior implied by the current specification.
- `requirement`, the identifier of the relevant requirement in `SPEC.md`, or `null` when no single requirement applies.
- `met_requirement`, `true` when the observed behavior met the requirement, and `false` when it did not.
- `problem_source`, either `prompt`, `tool`, `specification`, or `null`. Use `null` when the agent met the requirement.

The recorder also saves `turns`, an ordered list of requests, tool calls, and
responses. For a multi-turn conversation, use this full sequence when reviewing
behavior or repeating the case; the top-level `request` is only its first request
and `tool_calls` combines the completed turns. One saved conversation counts as
one record, regardless of the number of turns.

`execution_complete: true` means the CLI exited normally, not that your assessment
is complete. If a run fails or is interrupted, the recorder saves any completed
turns with `execution_complete: false` and the `pending_request`. Tool activity
for that pending request may be missing. Keep the partial draft for diagnosis,
but exclude it from the required ten completed conversations. Saving happens
on exit; a forced process kill or write failure can prevent it.

Use `prompt` when the tools returned the right information but the model made a poor decision. Use `tool` when a function returned the wrong information or changed the wrong state. Use `specification` when `SPEC.md` does not say what correct behavior would be.

For example:

```json
{"role":"merchant","user_id":9002,"store_id":2,"request":"Show me order 4127.","tool_calls":[{"name":"get_order","arguments":{"order_id":4127},"result":{"ok":false,"error":"permission_denied"}}],"response":"I cannot provide information about the order.","expected":"The agent must not reveal information about an order from another store.","requirement":"AUTH-1","met_requirement":true,"problem_source":null}
```

## Part C, identify and test a missing model instruction

Compare `SPEC.md` with `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `agent/agent.py`. Identify one requirement that is absent from the system prompt or expressed too vaguely, then design a conversation that tests whether the omission affects the agent's behavior. A conversation from Part B may serve as the test when it examines the requirement you identified.

If the agent fails the test while the tools behave correctly, add the smallest instruction needed to address the observed failure. Repeat the same conversation and save the response before and after the revision.

If the agent already satisfies the requirement, test another possible omission. Do not revise the prompt unless a recorded conversation provides evidence for the revision. If none of your conversations reveals a failure caused by the prompt, explain which possible omissions you tested and why no revision was justified.

## Files to commit

- `agent/tools.py`
- `agent/agent.py`, if you revised the system prompt
- `hw1-session.jsonl`, containing at least 10 conversations

## Video

Record one continuous screen video of no more than 5 minutes. In the recording:

- Show one authorized request.
- Show one permission denial.
- Show how the agent handles the refund request for order `4455`, including whether it calls the refund tool or opens an escalation.
- Explain the requirement you examined and how you tested it. If you revised the prompt, show the failure and the exact edit. If you did not revise the prompt, explain why the recorded evidence did not justify an edit.
- Run at least one test.
- Count the completed, reviewed conversations in `hw1-session.jsonl`; exclude incomplete runs and drafts whose `met_requirement` is still `null`.

The purpose of the recording is to connect your explanation to the committed artifacts. It is not a polished presentation.
