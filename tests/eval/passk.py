"""pass@k, pass^k, and the CI result for one case (Module 3, Lecture 1.3).

Your agent samples, so a single end-to-end run is a noisy measurement. These
three functions turn n observed runs of one evaluation case into a signal and a
decision:

  - :func:`pass_at_k` answers the capability question: can the agent EVER get
    this right? It rises with k.
  - :func:`pass_hat_k` (read "pass hat k") answers the reliability question:
    can the agent be trusted EVERY time? It falls with k.
  - :func:`case_passes` applies the course's CI rule: a regression case
    blocks on any failed run; a capability case never blocks CI, but its
    pass rate is reported for tracking.

CI must use the reliability view. The same 6-of-8 agent reads as 1.000 under
pass@4 and 0.214 under pass^4. Passing the case because one run in eight
succeeded would allow a broken behavior to merge.

All three are pure functions. No model call, no I/O. The homework tests pin
the worked numbers from the lecture (Artifact G), so a correct implementation
reproduces them exactly.

    pass@k is the probability that AT LEAST ONE of k i.i.d. runs succeeds.
    The naive estimate (run k times, check if any passed) wastes runs; the
    unbiased estimator from n >= k runs is:

        pass@k = 1 - C(n - c, k) / C(n, k)

    where C is the binomial coefficient (math.comb). The subtracted term is
    the probability that a random size-k subset of the n runs contains only

    The evaluation case set holds two kinds of case:

        (`passes < n`). A rerun is allowed only for infrastructure errors
        (those never reach this function; see replay/harness.py), never for
        a verdict flip.
      - A **capability** case covers a core behavior the agent has never
        held reliably. It never blocks CI, because forcing it to pass would
        make CI red forever. Instead, its pass rate is reported in the CI
        log and exported as a Module 5 improvement target.
